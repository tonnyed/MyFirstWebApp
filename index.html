            <h2>Why I Love Photography with Canon 5D Mark IV</h2>
            <p>
             I wanted to share a bit of my own passion for photography, especially using the Canon 5D Mark IV. It’s an incredible camera for both creative expression and technical exploration. Given your background, I think you’d find the intersection between photography and technology interesting. Here’s why:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensor Technology and Image Processing:</strong> The 5D Mark IV uses a full-frame 30.4MP sensor...</li>
                <li><strong>Autofocus and Computational Photography:</strong> The camera features a 61-point autofocus system...</li>
                <li><strong>RAW Image Data:</strong> The ability to shoot in RAW allows you to capture uncompressed data...</li>
                <li><strong>4K Video and Computing:</strong> The 5D Mark IV also shoots 4K video...</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Some Photos I Took</h2>
            <p>Here are a few shots I’ve taken with the Canon 5D Mark IV:</p>
